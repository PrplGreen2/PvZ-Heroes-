If the current state of PvZ Heroes' localization drives you mad, you've come to the right place! This **client-sided Mod** fixes all of the annoying text errors and bugs such as misleading ability text, displaying Keywords that AREN'T there *(looking at you Mime Gargantuar)* or NOT displaying Keywords that ARE THERE *(looking at you Bean Counter)*, and many many more!

This Mod will be updated regulary (if PopCap updated the game regularly), so don't ever worry about it being outdated!
